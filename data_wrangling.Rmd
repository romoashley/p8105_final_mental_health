# Step 1: Data import.
1) In this step I download and renamed the Mental_Health_Care_in_the_Last_4_Weeks.csv to mental_health.csv to my computer, then I imported it to R and name the dataset as rawdata.
2) during this step, I removing Unnecessary Columns including : phase, quartile range and suppression flag. Then, I also renamed some columns: Improving column names for clarity or consistency.

```{r}
rawdata = read_csv("data/mental_health.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(indicator = str_replace(indicator, ", Last 4 Weeks", "")) |> 
  select(-phase,-quartile_range,-suppression_flag) |> 
  mutate(group = str_replace(group, "By", ""))|> 
  select(start_date=time_period_start_date,end_date=time_period_end_date,everything()) 

```
