## Introduction

Welcome to our final project for our Data Science I course! Our project explores trends in mental health access in the United States since the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as differences in mental health access by various demographic characteristics.

We used existing data from the Household Pulse Survey, which is a nationally representative quantitative survey. Our data cleaning and analysis were conducted in RStudio.

We value transparency and reproducibility; as such, our R code is linked in our GitHub repository, which can be found by clicking [this link](https://github.com/romoashley/p8105_final_mental_health) or by clicking the icon on the top right navigation menu.
