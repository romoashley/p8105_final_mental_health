<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p><img src="images/mental_health_report.avif" style="width:50%"></p>
<p>COVID-19 has had serious behavioral and mental health implications.
One survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in July 2020 found that <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/13/health/mental-health-coronavirus-pandemic-cdc-study-wellness/index.html">41%</a>
of respondents were struggling with mental health issues stemming from
the pandemic. Different demographics have worse outcomes, such as <a
href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/02/mental-health-and-the-pandemic-what-u-s-surveys-have-found/">young
people</a>, and these outcomes are <a
href="https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/">continuing</a>
years after the pandemic first hit.</p>
<p>Our project aimed to explore trends and differences in indicators of
mental health care access across the United States from August 2020-May
2022, as well as disaggregate data by state, age group, gender,
race/ethnicity, education level, and sexual orientation.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<p>Many of us remember reading articles about the difficulty of
accessing therapists and counselors during the rise of the COVID-19
pandemic in spring 2020. Providers reported month-long waiting lists
that they have <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/18/health/mental-health-care-demand-wellness/index.html">never
seen</a> until the pandemic hit in spring 2020.</p>
<p>Yet these trends did not taper off; instead, they continued to
worsen. According to the <a
href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2021/10/mental-health-treatment-demand">American
Psychological Association</a>, the percent of psychologists who treat
anxiety and depression who saw an increase in demand for anxiety or
depression treatment increased by 13.5% and 20%, respectively, from 2020
to 2021. The number of psychologists who reported receiving more
referrals increased from 37% in 2020 to 62% in 2021. Nearly 7 in 10
psychologists with a waiting list in 2021 reported it had grown longer
since the start of the pandemic. Even through March 2022, prospective
patients are <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/03/06/therapist-covid-burnout/">still</a>
struggling to find providers who are accepting new patients or do not
have month-long waiting lists.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<div id="data-source" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Source</h3>
<p>We are using the <a
href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mental-health-care-in-the-last-4-weeks">Mental
Health Care in the Last 4 Weeks</a> data set. Data was collected as part
of the Pulse Household Survey across the United States with the U.S.
Census Bureau and numerous other federal agencies. The mental health
portion of the survey asks respondents to look back in the last 4 weeks
and answer whether they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Received counseling or therapy for mental health,</li>
<li>Took prescription medication for mental health, and</li>
<li>Needed counseling or therapy but did not get it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data set includes an additional indicator that combines those who
received counseling or therapy and/or took prescription medication for
mental health. The percentage of participants who responded “Yes” were
calculated for each of the 3 questions they were asked, as well as the
additional indicator. It is possible that participants respond “No” to
each of the 3 questions they are asked, so the values for the 3
questions do not add up to 100%.</p>
<p>Data was collected from a nationally representative sample of
approximately <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/mental-health-care.htm">50,000-90,000</a>
participants every two weeks for a total of 38 time periods of data
collection.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
<p>The data set is available for download in multiple formats on <a
href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mental-health-care-in-the-last-4-weeks">catalog.data.gov</a>,
and we downloaded the Comma Separated Values (.csv) file.</p>
<p>The first portion of data cleaning was the data import, which
involved downloading and importing the .csv using <code>read_csv</code>
and saving the raw data set.</p>
<p>The second portion of data cleaning was cleaning columns. This step
involved removing unnecessary columns, cleaning and renaming columns for
clarity, and dropping missing values.</p>
<p>The third portion of data cleaning was tidying the date formats. This
step involved converting dates to the date format using
<code>mdy</code>, creating a new numeric <code>year</code> variable, and
cleaning the week numbers and labels.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## part 1: importing raw data

following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the national prevalence over time?</li>
<li>Are there are the differences among states? Which states have the
highest values and which states have the lowest values?</li>
<li>Are there differences in indicators of mental health outcomes by
demographic characteristic (age, education level, gender,
race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation)?</li>
<li>What is the proportion of services needed but not received by

<div id="results-and-discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
<div id="national-level" class="section level4">
<h4>National-Level</h4>
<p>On average, those who took prescription medication for mental health
and/or received counseling or therapy had a highest values while those
who received counseling or therapy had the lowest value. There is a wide
gap in average values between those who took prescription medication for
mental health and those who needed counseling or therapy but did not get
it. Overall, each indicator had a small increase in average value
between 2020 and 2022. Additionally, the majority of states had a
similar estimate of proportion of mental health services not received
within each state. However, Vermont, Wyoming, Hawaii, and North Dakota
had distinct estimates, with a lower estimate compared to the remaining
states. Overall, Vermont had the lowest estimate.</p>
</div>
<div id="state-level" class="section level4">
<h4>State-Level</h4>
<p>After analysis of the four indicators by state, we found the lowest
prevalence of mental health care use in some of the most populous US
states: California, New York, Texas, and Florida. Medication use
prevalence was highest in West Virginia, Kentucky, Arkansas, Utah, and
Oklahoma. Except for Utah, these states have high rates of <a
href="https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17826">poverty</a> and
low <a
href="https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/median-annual-income/?activeTab=map&amp;currentTimeframe=0&amp;selectedDistributions=median-annual-household-income&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D">median
household income</a>, which could drive higher rates of mental health
medication use.</p>
<p>Therapy use was highest in District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Vermont, and Oregon. These states have high levels of <a
href="https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17829#P9452d1b2fc324fd3ba7da7fb1edf4e99_2_240iT2">educational
attainment</a> which could mean that their populations have more
positive perceptions of therapy. That said, the greatest change in
therapy use during the pandemic was in more rural states with lower
median household income, like Nebraska and North Dakota. It’s possible
that these were states that particularly benefited from expansions in
telehealth for providing therapy. When medication and therapy indicators
are combined to indicate overall mental health burden, West Virginia,
Utah, and Kentucky remain the highest, but are joined by Vermont and
Maine. Vermont, Maine, and Utah all have high median household income,
which suggests ruralness rather than income levels may drive mental
health burden at the state level.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the states with the highest prevalence of unmet
therapy needs also tended to have a higher prevalence of therapy use.
This could indicate that demand for therapy outpaced supply of mental
health care providers even with the expansion of telehealth during the
pandemic. However, West Virginia, which had a high prevalence of
medication use, did not have high unmet therapy needs. This could mean
that in certain states, medication use is not tied to therapy use.</p>
</div>
<div id="demographic-level" class="section level4">
<h4>Demographic-Level</h4>
<p>Age: The 18-29 age group has the highest values across all the
indicators, especially for the indicator of taking prescription
medication for mental health and or receiving counseling. This might be
due to the pandemic, where lockdown and transition to a virtual
environment cause additional pressure on this age group, and mental
health services are needed to relieve the overwhelming burdens. On the
other hand, the 60 and above age group has the lowest values of needed
counseling or therapy but did not get it and received counseling or
therapy. It might be due to a present f stigma around mental health,
where there might be low reports of expressing the need for counseling
or therapy.</p>
<p>Education: On average, the bachelor’s degree or higher group has the
highest value of taking prescription medication for mental health and/or
receiving counseling. On the other hand, those who have a lower
education levels (high school diploma or GED and less than high school
diploma groups) have the least value of needed counseling or therapy but
did not get it and received counseling or therapy indicators.</p>
<p>Gender: Women reported needing almost twice as much counseling or
therapy for mental health as men, and these trends were consistent from
2020 to 2022. Women took more prescription medication for mental health
and received more counseling or therapy for mental health than men.
These trends slightly increased each year from 2020 to 2022.</p>
<p>Race/ethnicity: Non-Hispanic multiracial group received the most
prescription medication and/or counseling or therapy for mental health
and needed counseling or therapy for mental health but did not receive
it more than any other racial/ethnic group. Their outcomes worsened over
time for all indicators. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latino groups
had very similar outcomes across all four indicators. Non-Hispanic
Asians received and needed the least mental health care out of all
racial/ethnic groups. Non-Hispanic White group was the most consistent
in their outcomes over time.</p>
<p>Sexual orientation: Out of all demographic characteristics, those who
identify as bisexual reported the highest rates of taking prescription
medication for mental health and/or receiving counseling or therapy, as
their rates reached over 50% at some time points in 2021 and 2022.
Individuals who identify as bisexual reported the highest trends in all
four indicators compared with gay or lesbian and straight Americans,
although they were closely followed by individuals who identify as gay
or lesbian. Outcomes in mental health access for individuals who
identify as bisexual showed the most variation over time. Individuals
