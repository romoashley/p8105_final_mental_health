<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p><img src="images/mental_health_report.avif" style="width:50%"></p>
<p>COVID-19 has had serious behavioral and mental health implications.
One survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in July 2020 found that <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/13/health/mental-health-coronavirus-pandemic-cdc-study-wellness/index.html">41%</a>
of respondents were struggling with mental health issues stemming from
the pandemic. Different demographics have worse outcomes, such as <a
href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/02/mental-health-and-the-pandemic-what-u-s-surveys-have-found/">young
people</a>, and these outcomes are <a
href="https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/">continuing</a>
years after the pandemic first hit.</p>
<p>Our project aimed to explore trends and differences in indicators of
mental health care access across the United States from August 2020-May
2022, as well as disaggregate data by state, age group, education level,
gender, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<p>Many of us remember reading articles about the difficulty of
accessing therapists and counselors during the rise of the COVID-19
pandemic in spring 2020. Providers reported month-long waiting lists
that they have <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/18/health/mental-health-care-demand-wellness/index.html">never
seen</a> until the pandemic hit in spring 2020.</p>
<p>Yet these trends did not taper off; instead, they continued to
worsen. According to the <a
href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2021/10/mental-health-treatment-demand">American
Psychological Association</a>, the percent of psychologists who treat
anxiety and depression who saw an increase in demand for anxiety or
depression treatment increased by 13.5% and 20%, respectively, from 2020
to 2021. The number of psychologists who reported receiving more
referrals increased from 37% in 2020 to 62% in 2021. Nearly 7 in 10
psychologists with a waiting list in 2021 reported it had grown longer
since the start of the pandemic. Even through March 2022, prospective
patients are <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/03/06/therapist-covid-burnout/">still</a>
struggling to find providers who are accepting new patients or do not
have month-long waiting lists.</p>

<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<div id="data-source" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Source</h3>
<p>We are using the <a
href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mental-health-care-in-the-last-4-weeks">Mental
Health Care in the Last 4 Weeks</a> data set. Data was collected as part
of the Pulse Household Survey across the United States with the U.S.
Census Bureau and numerous other federal agencies. The mental health
portion of the survey asks respondents to look back in the last 4 weeks
and answer whether they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Received counseling or therapy for mental health,</li>
<li>Took prescription medication for mental health, and</li>
<li>Needed counseling or therapy but did not get it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data set includes an additional indicator that combines those who
received counseling or therapy and/or took prescription medication for
mental health. The percentage of participants who responded “Yes” were
calculated for each of the 3 questions they were asked, as well as the
additional indicator. It is possible that participants respond “No” to
each of the 3 questions they are asked, so the values for the 3
questions do not add up to 100%.</p>
<p>Data was collected from a nationally representative sample of
approximately <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/mental-health-care.htm">50,000-90,000</a>
participants every two weeks for a total of 38 time periods of data
collection.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
<p>The data set is available for download in multiple formats on <a
href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mental-health-care-in-the-last-4-weeks">catalog.data.gov</a>,
and we downloaded the Comma Separated Values (.csv) file.</p>
<p>The first portion of data cleaning was the data import, which
involved downloading and importing the .csv using <code>read_csv</code>
and saving the raw data set.</p>
<p>The second portion of data cleaning was cleaning columns. This step
involved removing unnecessary columns, cleaning and renaming columns for
clarity, and dropping missing values.</p>
<p>The third portion of data cleaning was tidying the date formats. This
step involved converting dates to the date format using
<code>mdy</code>, creating a new numeric <code>year</code> variable, and
cleaning the week numbers and labels.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## part 1: importing raw data

<div id="final-data-set" class="section level3">
<h3>Final Data Set</h3>
<p>The final tidy data set included 13 variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>indicator</code> (chr): The type of mental health care.</li>
<li><code>year</code> (num): The year of the time period for data
collection.
<ul>
<li>If the time period for data collection continued onto the following
year, the year that data collection began was used for this

<li><code>week_number</code> (num): The week number of data collection.
<ul>
<li>It should be noted that the data set refers to “weeks” as the
two-week data collection period, so each week number indicates a
two-week period.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>week_label</code> (chr): The dates for the corresponding
week.</li>
<li><code>state</code> (chr): The state or national level data.</li>
<li><code>group</code> (chr): The demographic group.</li>
<li><code>subgroup</code> (chr): The specific subgroup within the
group.</li>
<li><code>value</code> (num): The value (percentage or number)
representing the indicator.</li>
<li><code>low_ci</code> (num): Lower bound of the confidence interval of
the value.</li>
<li><code>high_ci</code> (num): Upper bound of the confidence interval
of the value.</li>
<li><code>confidence_interval</code> (chr): Confidence interval as a
range.</li>

<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
<p>We are interested in identifying trends over time at the national,
state, and demographic level. Our initial questions were the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the national prevalence over time?</li>
<li>Are there are the differences among states? Which states have the
highest values and which states have the lowest values?</li>
<li>What is the proportion of services needed but not received by
individuals in New York?</li>
<li>What is the proportion of services needed but not received by
individuals across states?</li>
<li>Are there differences in indicators of mental health outcomes by
demographic characteristic (age, education level, gender,
race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation)? Are they statistically
significant?</li>
<li>Can we apply a linear model to the data?</li>
</ul>
<p>We were able to answer all of these questions through our
analyses.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>
<p>We conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) at the <a
href="EDA_AR.html">national-level</a>, <a
href="eda.html">state-level</a>, and <a
href="eda_demographic.html">demographic-level</a>.</p>
<div id="national-level" class="section level4">
<h4>National-Level</h4>
<p>To look at the prevalence in the United States, we filtered the data
set for the United States to focus national data rather then
state-specific data. Next, we grouped by year, start date, and indicator
to ensure we calculate the mean value for each indicator by start date
of data collected. After calculating the mean, we plotted the mean value
and start date to showcase the mean national value over time. The plot
shows a increase in prevalence between 2020 and 2022 with those who took
prescription medication for mental health and/or received counseling or
therapy with the highest prevalence and those who received counseling or
therapy with the lowest prevalence.</p>
<p><img src="report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<div id="state-level" class="section level4">
<h4>State-level</h4>
<p>To look at the prevalence of each indicator of mental health care
utilization by state, we filtered the main data set to only include
observations at the state-level. For subsequent analyses, we used filter
to select only observations for the indicator of interest. Next, we
grouped by state to calculate the mean prevalence of each indicator by
state, then created a table of the top 5 states by mean prevalence
between 2020-2022 for each indicator. Then, we created a heat map
showing mean prevalence by state for each indicator between 2020-2022
using the sf and maps packages. Next, we grouped by state and year to
calculate the mean prevalence by state and year and then calculate the
change in mean prevalence between 2020-2022 by state. Using this data,
we created a table of the 5 states with the highest change in mean
prevalence between 2020-2022 for each indicator. Lastly, we created an
interactive graph for each indicator showing change in mean prevalence
for each state over time using plotly. The result is 16 graphs or tables
that describe state-level trends in mental health care utilization and
access in the United States between 2020-2022.</p>
</div>
<div id="demographic-level" class="section level4">
<h4>Demographic-Level</h4>
<p>To look at the differences in indicators of mental health care access
by each of the 5 demographic groups (age group, education level, gender,
race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation), we filtered the main data set
to only include that demographic group and observations at the
national-level. We filtered for the weeks of data collection for one
demographic group, sexual orientation, because the Household Pulse
Survey only started collecting data on sexual orientation over halfway
through data collection. Next, we grouped the indicators by date and
demographic group, and re-leveled the demographic groups to show rates
from lowest to highest (or from youngest to oldest for age). Then, we
created line graphs for each of the 5 demographic groups showing the
trends in the 4 indicators of mental health access over time in the
United States.</p>
<p>The line graph for sexual orientation shows stark differences between
groups.</p>
<p><img src="eda_demographic_files/figure-html/sexuality-1.png" style="width:100%"></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="additional-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Additional Analysis</h2>
<p>We conducted <a href="statistical_analysis.html">independent samples
t-tests and ANOVA</a> to determine if there were statistically
significant differences in access to mental health for each demographic
characteristic.</p>
<div id="bivariate-analysis" class="section level4">
<h4>Bivariate Analysis</h4>
<p>We conducted bivariate analysis to see if there is a statistical
relationship between each demographic characteristic and two of our
indicators of mental health access: took prescription medication and/or
received counseling or therapy for mental health, and needed counseling
or therapy for mental health but did not get it. P-values less than 0.05
were considered as statistically significant.</p>
<p>Since gender is binary, we ran an independent samples t-test. The
remaining demographic characteristics (age group, education level,
race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation) all have three or more
categories, so we ran one-way ANOVA tests within them.</p>
</div>
<div id="linear-modeling" class="section level4">
<h4>Linear Modeling</h4>
<p>In an attempt to use a linear model, we used the stepwise function to
see if adding the variable, subgroup, was useful in identifying the best
linear model for our data set. Upon further analysis, we realized that
the stepwise approached was ineffective given that all our predictors
are under one variable, subgroup.</p>
<p>We attempted to rearrange the data using the pivot_wider function to
isolate each predictor to a distinct variable rather than having all of
our predictors under the subgroup variable. However, we came across
challenges. First, the data for each predictor has a different value for
each week. Second, the number the predictors differed across weeks.
Given that our data set is grouped data, we were unable to organize our
data set in a way that allowed us to isolated predictors and apply a
linear model with each demographic characteristic as a predictor.</p>

<h4>National-Level</h4>
<p>On average, those who took prescription medication for mental health
and/or received counseling or therapy had the highest values while those
who received counseling or therapy had the lowest values. Evidence
suggests that having <a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5550525/">more
therapy session may improve patient outcomes</a>. Therefore, those who
received counseling or therapy may have a lower prevalence because they
may not go to therapy or counseling as often as they would like to due
to schedule conflicts or cost.</p>
<p>Overall, each indicator had a increase in prevalence between 2020 and
2022. During the pandemic, services were restricted due to the shelter
in place order. Consequently, therapist were forced to have virtual
therapy sessions rather than in-person therapy sessions, which resulted
in many <a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8339462/">challenges</a>
such as distractions, challenges with emotional connectedness, and
privacy concerns. Not only were individuals living through a threatening
pandemic, many individuals did not have access to mental health service
they had access to before the pandemic. After the pandemic, the nation
ended its shut down and services that were halted were resumed. This
transition from the shut down may explain why the prevalence was low in
2020 and has increased since then.</p>

<h4>State-Level</h4>
<p>After analysis of the four indicators by state, we found the lowest
prevalence of mental health care use in some of the most populous US
states: California, New York, Texas, and Florida. Medication use
prevalence was highest in West Virginia, Kentucky, Arkansas, Utah, and
Oklahoma. Except for Utah, these states have high rates of <a
href="https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17826">poverty</a> and
low <a
href="https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/median-annual-income/?activeTab=map&amp;currentTimeframe=0&amp;selectedDistributions=median-annual-household-income&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D">median
household income</a>, which could drive higher rates of mental health
medication use.</p>
<p><img src="images/med_map.png" style="width:100%"></p>
<p>Therapy use was highest in District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Vermont, and Oregon. These states have high levels of <a
href="https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17829#P9452d1b2fc324fd3ba7da7fb1edf4e99_2_240iT2">educational
attainment</a> which could mean that their populations have more
positive perceptions of therapy. That said, the greatest change in
therapy use during the pandemic was in more rural states with lower
median household income, like Nebraska and North Dakota. It is possible
that these were states that particularly benefited from expansions in
telehealth for providing therapy. When medication and therapy indicators
are combined to indicate overall mental health burden, West Virginia,
Utah, and Kentucky remain the highest, but are joined by Vermont and
Maine. Vermont, Maine, and Utah all have high median household income,
which suggests ruralness rather than income levels may drive mental
health burden at the state level.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the states with the highest prevalence of unmet
therapy needs also tended to have a higher prevalence of therapy use.
This could indicate that demand for therapy outpaced supply of mental
health care providers even with the expansion of telehealth during the
pandemic. However, West Virginia, which had a high prevalence of
medication use, did not have high unmet therapy needs. This could mean
that in certain states, medication use is not tied to therapy use.</p>

<div id="demographic-level-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Demographic-Level</h4>
<p><em>Age:</em> Differences in taking prescription medication and/or
receiving counseling or therapy for mental health, as well as needing
but not receiving counseling or therapy for mental health, were
statistically different across age groups. The 18-29 age group has the
highest values across all the indicators, especially for the indicator
of taking prescription medication for mental health and or receiving
counseling. This might be due to the pandemic, where lockdown and
transition to a virtual environment cause additional pressure on this
age group, and mental health services are needed to relieve the
overwhelming burdens. On the other hand, the 60 and above age group has
the lowest values of needed counseling or therapy but did not get it and
received counseling or therapy. It might be due to stigma around mental
health, where there might be low reports of expressing the need for
counseling or therapy.</p>
<p><em>Education:</em> On average, the bachelor’s degree or higher group
has the highest rates of taking prescription medication for mental
health and/or receiving counseling. On the other hand, those who have a
lower education levels (high school diploma or GED and less than high
school diploma groups) have the lowest rates of needing counseling or
therapy but not getting it and received counseling or therapy
indicators. Differences in taking prescription medication and/or
receiving counseling or therapy for mental health and in needing but not
receiving counseling or therapy for mental health were statistically
different across education levels.</p>
<p><em>Gender:</em> Women reported significantly higher rates of taking
prescription medication and/or receiving counseling or therapy for
mental health than men. Women took more prescription medication for
mental health and received more counseling or therapy for mental health
than men, and these trends slightly increased each year from 2020 to
2022. Additionally, women reported significantly higher rates of needing
but not receiving counseling or therapy for mental health than men.
These findings are not surprising given gender norms and expectations
for men and the framing of seeking help as a feminine trait.</p>
<p><em>Race/ethnicity:</em> Differences in taking prescription
medication and/or receiving counseling or therapy for mental health, as
well as needing but not receiving counseling or therapy for mental
health, were statistically different across racial/ethnic groups.
Non-Hispanic multiracial group received the most prescription medication
and/or counseling or therapy for mental health and needed counseling or
therapy for mental health but did not receive it more than any other
racial/ethnic group. Their outcomes worsened over time for all
indicators. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latino groups had very
similar outcomes across all four indicators. Non-Hispanic Asians
received and needed the least mental health care out of all
racial/ethnic groups. Non-Hispanic White group was the most consistent
in their outcomes over time.</p>
<p><em>Sexual orientation:</em> Out of all demographic characteristics,
those who identify as bisexual reported the highest rates of taking
prescription medication for mental health and/or receiving counseling or
therapy, as their rates reached over 50% at some time points in 2021 and
2022. Individuals who identify as bisexual reported the highest trends
in all four indicators compared with gay or lesbian and straight
Americans, although they were closely followed by individuals who
identify as gay or lesbian. Outcomes in mental health access for
individuals who identify as bisexual showed the most variation over
time. Individuals who identify as straight reported the least unmet need
for counseling or therapy, and their outcomes were consistent over time.
Differences in taking prescription medication and/or receiving
counseling or therapy for mental health and in needing but not receiving
counseling or therapy for mental health were statistically different
across sexual orientation groups.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our findings reflect the increasing demand for therapists and
counselors that inspired our work. Nationally, prevalence of both mental
health care utilization and unmet mental health care need increased
between 2020-2022. These trends were most prominent in rural states. Our
demographic analyses revealed the highest demand for mental health
services among young adults, those with higher education, women, those
who identified as non-Hispanic multiracial, and those who identify as
bisexual. Our conclusion is that mental health care services must
continue to grow to meet increasing demand since the COVID-19 pandemic.
Importantly, the data set we used may not reflect the actual prevalence
of mental health disorders, because there are many people who live with
undiagnosed disorders (due to lack of access to care or stigma related
to receiving care) or who do live with a diagnosis but do not pursue
care. This may explain the lower prevalence of mental health care
utilization and unmet need among certain groups, such as older adults.
Health promotion campaigns may be needed to normalize mental health care
utilization and reduce stigma.</p>
<p>In the future, it would be interesting to expand this analysis
project to analyze the trend of accessing therapists and counselors
post-pandemic. Another potential future analysis will be to compare if
there is a difference in individual access to therapists and counselors
and if the differences vary by demographic characteristics and levels.
Individual-level data would also allow us to perform intersectional
analyses that acknowledge the intersection of multiple identities (age,
race, gender, etc.) as shaping mental health care experiences.</p>
